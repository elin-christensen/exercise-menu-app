# Menu Price App (.NET)

Simple .NET application that displays menu prices based on user age input.

This project was created as a learning exercise to practice:
- Model–View–ViewModel structure
- Using ViewModels to separate UI and logic
- Basic input handling and conditional pricing logic

No external dependencies.
